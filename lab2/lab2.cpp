//Set the random number as a variable called guess. (whatever code for random between 1-50)
//set score to 10 or 5 (so they can guess a bit)
//Print "Please enter your guess:"
//if Guess is too high, print "Lower" and take one point away (if number > guess, print "lower")
//if guess is too low, print "higher" and take one point away (if number < guess, print "higher")
//if guess is correct, add 10 pts to score and print "you win!"
//if score = 0, print "game over"
